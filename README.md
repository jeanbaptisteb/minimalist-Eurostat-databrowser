# Minimalist Eurostat Data Browser
**Important: this add-on is not endorsed by Eurostat, and I'm not affiliated to them in any way.**

This is a Firefox add-on project to simplify the [Eurostat Data Browser](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/) interface, when exploring detailed statistics pages. Here's an example of a page in the scope of the add-on: [Participation rate in education and training by degree of urbanisation ](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/TRNG_AES_105/default/table?lang=en&category=degurb.degurb_trng). 

In short, the purpose of the add-on is to change a few things to this interface, by removing or by changing the size and position of various elements, that are not necessarily relevant when you just want to focus on the data. 

The add-on is still in its development phase with a lot of things to fix or to add, and for this reason I've not made it available on the public Firefox list of add-ons. You can still test it (if you feel bold), but I wouldn't recommend it. The code is however publicly available in this repository, so feel to contribute, report bugs, or even fork the project.
